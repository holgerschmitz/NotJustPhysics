# NotJustPhysics

This repository contains code snippets from the [NotJustPhysics blog](https://notjustphysics.com/blog) and other bits and pieces that I am trying out.

In a way, this is my public sandbox.

Everything in this repository is on the `master` branch. 

There are no releases and none of th code is maintained.
